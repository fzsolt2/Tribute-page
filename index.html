                    <li>8 april 1979: The day he was born.</li>
            
                    <li>1993: Together with Jaska Raatikainen they formed Children of Bodom under the name Inearthed.</li>
            
                    <li>2002: Laiho married Kim Goss during a private ceremony in Finland. Prior to the marriage, they dated for
                    four years. In 2004 they separated, but still remain close friends.</li>
            
                    <li>2004: Laiho founded a side-project called Kylähullut, which was assembled together with Tonmi Lillman
                    (ex-Sinergy) and Vesa Jokinen 69er (from Klamydia). The band was created merely for the entertainment of
                    the musicians, and takes a carefree approach to their music. The band's discography includes two EP's, and
                    two full-length albums.</li>
            
                    <li>2009: Children of Bodom was forced to drop out of their North American "No Fear Energy Tour" when Laiho
                    broke his wrist after falling out of his bunk, when the tour bus took a sharp turn on April 26, 2009, after
                    the show in Palladium Ballroom, Dallas TX. Laiho originally planned to continue touring despite his injury,
                    but was forced to cancel the last six dates when any efforts to alleviate the pain failed.</li>
    
                    <li>3 July 2012: Children of Bodom announced on their Facebook page that they had to cancel two European shows
                    because Laiho had been taken to the hospital. The band released this statement: “It is with great regret that
                    we are forced to cancel tonight’s show in Oslo as well as tomorrow night’s show in Malmö. Alexi was rushed to
                    the Oslo hospital earlier this evening with extreme stomach pain. The doctors in the emergency unit checked
                    him and while we are still waiting for a diagnosis, they made clear that he will not be able to perform
                    within the next 48 hours. We apologize to all our fans who have bought tickets to these shows – we will try to
                    reschedule both Oslo and Malmö at the earliest possibility. Keep your fingers crossed with us that Alexi will
                    get well again soon!”</li>
    
                    <li>2019: Children of Bodom played their last show at the Black Box in Helsinki, dubbed “A Chapter Called
                    Children of Bodom.” This followed the announcement in November that after this show, all members of the band
                    except Laiho and guitarist Daniel Freyberg had quit. Following their departure, it was revealed that due to 
                    legal reasons, Laiho would need permission from his former band mates to continue using the Children of Bodom
                    name.</li>
    
                    <li>March 2020: Laiho and Freyberg officially announced their new band, Bodom After Midnight, named after the
                    second track from the album Follow the Reaper. This officially marked the end of Children of Bodom.</li>
